# Learning Journal

I have learnt a lot about github and its capabilities for helping me keep my work organised and updated along the course. 

Today's task of creating instructions to draw a simple drawing has shown me how people (and essentially computers) interpret something differently based on the wording and detail that is provided within the instructions. Even with simple images consisting of 12 or less lines can present a large hurdle when describing exactly how it is drawn in a step by step basis. This has urged me to be more thorough when working with instructions or scripts such as coding and programming.
